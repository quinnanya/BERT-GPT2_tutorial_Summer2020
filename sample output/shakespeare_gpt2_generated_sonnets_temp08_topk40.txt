======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
A man who taught me to love

And winked at jealousy in my heart,

Had a passion of his own, of foul name,

That over many a wound might define;

Thus do I knowledge in love and hatred write,

Whose fair due is all; and the truth a l'oeil,

In hate and in triumph, lives in my heart:

Thus then I am but a mange, and love not shame,

Since 'tis well I hate the trouble of it,

Since all my hate was but a dream, and hate forgot;

And hatred of wanting things thus: yet
 ~~ Not to speak of love's good looks,
   Is better than that humour'd in envy,
 ~~ Being fond of old things, makes new ones come.

  Mine eye hath play'd the painter, and laid the impression;
  My brain the sculptor's, and my heart the impression:
  The soil, or the veins whereon it needs grow,
  Crooked canker puts the bestily of science in my mind;
  The buds of my eye, when they see them said to grow,
  Joint made with force of love in my heart,
  Divert that force with force of truth to truth,
  And pace on, saucy walks with swift motion,
  In thy motion swift is my heart, which in thy heart
  Tended to win and lose, not stay, saucy heares thee prove.
    All that's counterfeit is love's report,
    That tongue that tells the story more is better than the mute song:
     Sweet lily, tell it how, and sing it for me:
     If it rhyme, remember it well.

  Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
  To speak of old? Why didst not thy Muse give thee light
  As fast as lightning? Why did no Muse write thus:
  'Lord, give me thee this extern,
  To show thee thy might and goodness in thy art:
  Give not love too early, and love too late;
  All my loving should have been in my love;
  For me it was not enough that way;
  As thine & thou: before, in, and for me,
  That eternal love devis'd.
    Give it again, and I will take it;
    All this with thy sweet light bending my verse!

  Love is too weak a eye to catch
  All that is evil in thy glance,
  Which makes my heart swerve in thy rudiments:
  Then is the love of spotless speed able
  To sublimate the beauty of my eye;
  But, love, in this subtle art of dark,
  I learn not the true name of love,
  But rather the true beauty of thy soul:
  Then, mine eye hath straight seen that this thou bear,
  Thou art the beauty of the UAE:
  Thou know'st to my love that wallpaper is,
  A desert overbid gold, and buried it,
  The only ken still in our knowledge;
  Making it a second beauty to thee,
  It hath lost the appeal of the desert,
  Pointing it where thy love doth store,
  Straight in thy heart where thou art loved.
    Then believe me, my love, thy love dost lie,
    When thou provest me, my love mayst but glance dead,
    From thy face to thy mind's eye.

  XLVII

  Mine eye hath seen that thy love
 is not of the desert,
  But that the contrary be the case,
  In thy face is it formed,
  And for a tenant therein lies the bay,
  To checkiness's booty? Or, if it be small,
  Even so, it be's fatal flaw
  Which would put an end to thy love
  In thy shop or on thy door?
  Is it not the eye that looks into the shop,
  That looks into thy face and sees thou lov'st?
  Or, if it be small, thy love beans itself,
  And touches heaven's cheek that is thy room:
    If it be large, thy love bearest this
    Wherethegoalier thy love knows no compunction.

 The question now,
 'Will the living Muse of Muse-doth razed, and
  Kill his son, take his wife, take all this away?
  No, he will not live to hear that Muse's groan;
  But, if he do, he will live to see new life,
  In which quiet is not too much offence to hear,
    And not speaking of offence, not looking at nothing,
    That's all.
     Your life is short, his is all frown.

  Not from the stars, nor from the proud hand that hold
  These earth's nurs'd millions to birth,
  Can I not say that you yourself are gods to me?
  The barren hill where I grew grew, and tilled it,
  O account for loss, for favour; for favour, O account for joy;
  For joy, O account for hand, for me myself.
  And now, me both, now well pleased with my days,
  I find myself the centre of praise,
  Whilst the world to my me holds the blow,
  Making me the seat of public praise;
  Now full of praise, I tell the world my good day,
  And that silver it was, by your own hand, I'll show.
    In the morning, when I have no time to mourn,
    My face bears your account of all the days.

  Weary to travel, anxious to set you straight,
  Am I, or I, or I,
  Am all-consuming journey de recin
  Heretic, and miseratean, and aside.
  My days are many, and many a hand's work go'd
  Around me, and there keeps being to my mind
  The place where Thepresenttion doth proceed,
  And constant growth telling my course:
  But as I know the mind of wild beast
  Is hand-in-hand with my words, so my language
  Is doth keep growing The more I go on,
  Feeding on the fear of the wild;
  But whether he doohyds me not to speak,
  Or else he is coy, and keeps all that he doth say.
    To win me his due he must travel,
    With his tongue and eyes so cunning as those
    Of churls, and half-learned men that tongue.

  LIII

  Self-love is a habit, which in my soul
  Plants up fears and fearsakers With thoughts far worse Than Your Own,
  Loses all character by like example to My Chair;
  And though that my Nativity be stolen Away,
  My dear Nativity bear'd my proud crime In my self-love:
  For, like a sad flower I flight,
  My dear beloved loves to the top of Flattery,
  And here Fairbum short of all the rest,
  Flee'd with the clear eye to your groan.
    And why, love and war, and all the rest,
    Eat up your mountain of love and now lose me!

<|endoftext|>

  LIV

  When in the morning I let go my love,
  And scything thoughts and feelings stay
  My head, thinking my heart round for a monitor,
  Or sending my thoughts and feelings through a mat,
  Heretic and aside critic, critic and aside.
  But when in the morning I take my seat,
  Sent by myself no critic, no write:
  I even write of myself--of myself only;
  I always fresh, never stale, never painted,
  As though it were some gift from heaven,
  Making no mention of blog or page;
  I leave my thoughts, my thoughts, my thoughts,
  What my body--from far off, yet still fresh air,--
  Art--a page of my mind------ never from me
  Had for a scar or a wound,--
  Now found only my mind and heart,
  Boundless, fresh, and imaginary--
    And all too curious, for I think see strange
    That part of myself I--past strange
    and imaginary, and thoughts, and thingsness.

  Those lines that make me love her the more,
  Do I not read in that sweet, sweet, warm pen,
  With her pretty lovely minutes
