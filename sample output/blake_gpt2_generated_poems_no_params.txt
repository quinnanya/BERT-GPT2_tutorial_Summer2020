But first appear the tame grasshopper, who does not dread his foe; but they were both
devils, and flew not by visible means, but by an emceeing
marker, which flew down into the deep, where we
held for an hour, and then leaped in the air, and caught the wing
of Falcon.

God did create this world in its greatest possible virtue,
and did so because he was advised by the Jews, and because they saw
their country's eternal lot, and wished to impose upon it.

sitting here through the night,
     Your soft face and soft neck
     Are the single love I have.

A man gives his joy to his foe, and he doth his vengeance on the littleer:
  But how the little harlot's grief is rectified, and what is my share?
  I tell you, it is only a fox and a rabbit alike."
  So I answered: "One man's shock is another's grief a
trois."
  And so I summarised my friend Darwish's works as follows:---- "He was a true harlot, and
most dangerous man to excommunicate. He lived not for himself, but for all, that
converse among them, and saw the consequences of their opinions.

"Thus Swedenborg boasts that what he writes is new; though it is only
the contents or index of already published books.

"If you please, I will give you a copy of my Principles, and send you
either to religious instruction or to conversed opinion.

"But find me a book, and send me not by land or sea, but
mark the space of two days marked by objects of worship.

"If you like, keep me from being overwhelmed, for I shall overwhelm you
and destroy all that stands in my way.

"Pity is a dead principle, and I shall become the active pusher.

"Turn away no more; fear nothing more; remain still, and I will remain invisible."

I disappeared from my observance with a shriek, and got no further.

Then, hearing that two days old boy was under threat, I sought his den
and got there no more; but I found him asleep, and determined
to go find him.

Then, Thel of Swedenborg's book is a dead letter, and all that is
historical is true; but his writings are all that is written in the printing- press.

Thus Swedenborg's writings are both true and possible; for they appear to man
as he does, and he becomes what he sees.

For Swedenborg was always understood to be standing still, and that he
acted without ceasing; but that he was acting now, he is true.

For when he is ready, the world will perceive his existence, and he will cease to be
perception.

For when he is ready, the world will perceive his aversion to
excess and desire his own preservation.

For Swedenborg was always understood to be walking a straight line
long enough to be compelled to speak of himself as if he
was passing away.

For Swedenborg was always ready to speak his mind as he did, and then
said what he would, and so he was with his last thought.

"Now hear a plain fact: when I was a child I never
saw anything so plain as this."--

Listen to this plain fact: when a man has done
his part, he becomes mortal; when he does not, he becomes eternal.

For Swedenborg was a man of eternal time, and passed all the
religious prohibitions into his own hand.

For Swedenborg was a man of infinite Wisdom, and passed all the
religious prohibitions into the
fury of the thrall.

For Swedenborg was always understood to be a watchman, and
all that is mechanical is waiting for the watchman.

For Swedenborg was always ready to speak his mind as he did, and
hear what he would, and so he was.

The Soul

3. That no man has a body distinct from himself,
appears from the philosophy of the East.

It is so with Swedenborg, who, at Constantinople, asked the
Prussian why he ate dung, and not the lion why he fed

the lion.

The lion, who is the poison, is the soul.

The burgundy pearl is not enough.

Where do you hear the chimes of war?

Listen to the fool's growl;

When his fibrous head
 urchained his mate was dead,

The lamb was incapable of self-knowledge.

Listen to the eagle's rush,

When his fierce barbs are piteous,

The human form divine,
     And the human face honey
     Is a composite of all
     And all the human face
     Is of equal value with his boneless
     Tail.

The human form divine is likened to the roof of a
sea-house.

The human face is the roof of a palace.

The human form divine is idolatry.

The human face contains poison.

If the human face was a furnace,
     The human heart was a hollow tree.


_Note._--This is an analysis of a number of ancient
 writings, which were transmitted from generation to generation,
     And are now seen to this day in every citizen's mind.

   And all the merlows fled,
     To the deep they ambush.

   Where the wolves of the bush
     Are stored, the birds comforted,
   And the mastiffs mild.

   Where the sun does set,
     The fish smiles on the deep,
   And the dews of night arise,
     The hum of the netless,
   Is drowned in the silent stream.

   "And we sleep no more;
     The predators sleep in the next
     Chant, and the bees in the midst.
   "For, when our minds have clear,
     The moon is at rest,
   The stars are allayed,
     And the grass mild is gone out."

   "For, when our minds have clear,
     The moon is gone down,
   The birds are all gone to sleep.
     And the grass wild is gone out."

THE EARTH


"Thus unintentionally blind thy beams are,
   Like the Jews' methodical advert:
   They look abroad for aid,
   And not return:
   It is only
     There is earth to spread."


_Note._--This is done with a dreamy flourish:
   An angel enters the dream,
   And the fool sees the reason:
   For he has seen the folly that was forged.


   The sea fled, the shore blown away,
   And the man who made the sea see.
   The earth turned away,
   And the flood wiped away all innocence.
   The earth turned away,
   And the man who made the earth turn away!

   The gods of the earth and sea
   Sought through nature to find
   The weak worm Varied seed,
   And their search was all in vain:
   There grows one who loves the lowly.

Joys raised above description.
